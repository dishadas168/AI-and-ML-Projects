# 8R redundant robotic arm
Kinematic Control of a Redundant Manipulator

MATLAB simulation of a robotic arm with 8 rotational joints. The algorithm is based on the method of task decomposition. The first task of the end-effector is to follow a predefined path. The second task is to avoid two obstacles in the cartesian space by maximizing an objective function.
